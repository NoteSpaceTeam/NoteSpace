**NoteSpace** is a collaborative web platform that combines real-time collaboration with version control systems. Users can collaborate on markdown-based documents in real time, organize them into workspaces and folders, track changes through commits, and share or fork public workspaces.

## Overview

### Real-Time Collaboration
Edit the same document with multiple people at once. Changes sync instantly, even with concurrent edits, while keeping everyone in a consistent state, using the Fugue CRDT algorithm.

### Workspace Management
Organize notes and documents into workspaces and folders, with workspace-based access control for shared collaboration.

### Markdown Support
Write using markdown with live rendering. Supports standard formatting for fast, clean note-taking and technical documentation, such as headers, list items, and more.

### Version Control
Track changes, view past versions, and revert when needed using the built-in version control system.
