## Overview

### Real-Time Collaboration
Edit the same document with multiple people simultaneously, with changes syncing instantly even during concurrent edits, while keeping everyone in a consistent state using CRDTs.

### Workspace Management
Organize documents into workspaces and folders with a file-system structure and workspace-based access control.

### Markdown Support
Write documents using Markdown with live rendering. Supports standard formatting for fast, clean note-taking and technical documentation, such as headers, list items, and more.

### Version Control
Track changes, view past versions, and revert when needed using the built-in version control system.
